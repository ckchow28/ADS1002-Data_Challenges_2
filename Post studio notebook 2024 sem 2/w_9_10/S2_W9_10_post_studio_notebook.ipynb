    "In this exercise you are going to construct a simple one vs rest multiclass classifier based on the probabilities for each of the binary problems for the three iris species. A one-vs-rest classification scheme constructs multiple models (one for each class) where each model predicts a binary classification and combines the results to come up with a single prediction.\n",

    "    * For each of the iris categories, i.e., species_setosa, species_versicolor, and species_virginica, model the data using Logistic Regression and calculate the probabilities for the testing set of the category being correct. Store these probabilites in an array (or dataframe). For each category you will need to re-do the train-test split, but make sure you use the same random state (random state 1). Alternatively, split the data set initially with all three labels, and then work on each category. The necessary one-hot encoding has already been performed.\n",

    "* Exercise 2: \n",
    "    * For each instance in feature space (testing set), choose the category with the highest probability. The function `numpy.argmax()` will be useful.     \n",
    "    * **Output:** Show first 5 entries for sepal_length, sepal_width, max probability and predicted class.\n",
    "    * **Output:** Plot the final classification for the testing set in feature space, with colours based on the predicted category.\n",
