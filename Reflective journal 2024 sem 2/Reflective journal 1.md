# Reflective Journal 1: `Your group project last semester `
<br>

## Last semester I was a part of a data science team to contribute my insights and analysis on the housing rental group project in the Klang valley area. Overall, I was overwhelmed and grateful to be in the part of the project because I was able to mingle with my peers and learn to process raw data into useful information.

## To be specific, we were given a vast amount of data in the beginning and was required to extract meaningful chunks of data to be visualized and presented in week 12.  We processed the data using codes learnt during the studios by using python, besides of coming out with some regression models notably the random forest regressor model that predicts the future rental trend precisely. Generally, I worked well with my teammates, however with some issues with one of the team members who did minimal contribution as she went for a vacation. This experience taught me to communicate with my members in a more approachable way to overcome all obstacles we faced. In the end, we showed our spirits as a team and managed to accomplish the task in a brilliant way.

## In short, the group project went well as we did our job in cleaning, processing and visualizing the data. From my perspective, I think that we can start the project earlier next time to avoid cramming and rushing of work. In this way, we will have ample time to brainstorm and giving valuable insights into the data given.
