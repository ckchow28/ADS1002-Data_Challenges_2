# Reflective Journal 2: `ADS1002 project `
 Week 3: Are you happy with project you were assigned to? How did you (personally) deal with challenging tasks?
<hr>


For this semester, we were assigned for three different projects as it was like last semester. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the project topics as they are quite interesting. I am really excited and looking forward to choose a topic of my interest, to be specific the forecasting sales project for Rossman store.

However, the project assigned is quite challenging because of the vast amount of testing and training data set for the model. When I first look at the excel file containing all the data, I was taken aback due to the huge workload.  Hence, I immediately discussed with my team members about this issue and all of us agreed that we should start the project as soon as possible. This is because it requires our heart and soul to thrive in this project. Based on my analysis, we have to apply the knowledge learnt in the class to wrangle the data. For instance, we have to clean the data first using methods such as the chaining method or pipe method which is extremely useful. Furthermore, we also have to measure errors for regression and classification models for a precise model fitting. 

In conclusion, the early stage of project is challenging, but still doable with teamwork. In my opinion, we should focus on cleaning and handling the data more meticulously in the future weeks. In this way, all of our hard work will make the visualization and presentation process to be smoother, hence completing the project brilliantly.
