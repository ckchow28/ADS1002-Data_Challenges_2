In this semester, I am assigned to the same group again as I was in last semester. This week, our group had agreed to choose the topic of Rossman store sales forecasting. Overall, I feel happy and satisfied to work together with the same team members again. This is because we had mingled and worked closely before last semester. Hence, I am confident that we will not have any miscommunication problems.

This time, all of us delegated the required tasks to be completed in a more efficient and systematic manner.  My role in the group is quite similar to last time. To be precise, I have to clean the dataset before week 6. In this context, I decided to use the pandas pipe method to wrangle the data. This is a clearer and readable way for me to chain multiple data processing functions. However, I have encountered obstacles when dealing with time series data. Thus, I discussed this topic thoroughly with my teammates. Therefore, all of us studied the Jupyter notebook prepared by Dr. Ashish carefully. Finally, we manage to analyse the time series data successfully.

In conclusion, my teammates and I collaborated in a more proficient way as compared to last semester. The reason is because we understand well our own obligations in a data scientist team. In the future, I am planning to have more meetings with my teammates. This is a good way for us to discuss more about the project and solve every problem we encounter. Teamwork makes the dream work!
