    "    Learning by Adjusting: Imagine you're trying to hit the bullseye on a dartboard, but you're blindfolded. The first time you throw the dart, it lands somewhere random. After each throw, someone tells you whether you need to aim higher, lower, left, or right to get closer to the bullseye.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Small Steps: Instead of making a big change in your aim (which might make you overshoot), you make small, careful adjustments based on the feedback you get. If the dart landed too high, you aim slightly lower the next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Repeating the Process: You keep throwing the dart, adjusting a little bit each time, and slowly, your throws start getting closer and closer to the bullseye.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finding the Best Solution: Eventually, after many small adjustments, you might hit the bullseye or get very close to it. This is the point where your aim is as good as it can get."
